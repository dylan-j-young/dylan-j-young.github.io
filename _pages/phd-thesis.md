I spent seven years (2018-2025) on my physics Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. James K. Thompson at the University of Colorado, Boulder in an institute called [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/). While there, I pushed the frontiers of a field called quantum simulation by controlling and harnessing ultracold atoms and light in new ways, resulting in 10 published works that include two first-author publications in high-impact journals. Those papers can be found on my Google Scholar and ORCID profiles.

Are you a non-physicist and want to learn more? Watch the "What is quantum simulation?" chapter of my thesis defense below! (2:12-11:31). It's not too technical, I promise. Later chapters of the presentation dive deeper and assume a progressively more advanced level of understanding.

For fellow physicists interested in the technical details in all their unabridged glory, take a look at my thesis [here](https://jila.colorado.edu/sites/default/files/2025-10/DylanYoung_PhDThesis_2025_0.pdf).
