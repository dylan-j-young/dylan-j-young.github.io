My name is Dylan, and I'm a trained physicist applying for data scientist roles. Nice to meet you!

I recently completed my Ph.D. work at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying new ways to simulate quantum physics using lasers, cold atoms, and a tool called an optical cavity. Using this unconventional setup, I led pioneering work observing new behavior in materials called superconductors, resulting in [a first-author paper in *Nature* magazine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06911-x). 

My experience as a researcher taught me essential data science skills. I've built pipelines in Python to analyze large volumes of time series data in real time, performed hypothesis testing using targeted experimentation, and used advanced statistical analysis involving uncertainty propagation and bias characterization for precision measurement. I'm excited about applying these skills to solve real-world data science problems with truth-seeking, quantitative rigor.

Outside of work, I like choir and barbershop singing, playing board games, lifting weights, and trying uncommon foods.
