My name is Dylan, and I'm a trained physicist applying for data scientist roles. Nice to meet you!

I recently completed my Ph.D. work at the University of Colorado, Boulder studying new ways to simulate quantum phenomena using lasers, cold atoms, and a tool called an optical cavity. This experience made me interested in modeling complex systems, and it gave me the skills to tackle big projects efficiently and with scientific rigor. I'm excited about applying a similar mindset to solving real-world problems with data science and machine learning.

Outside of work, I like singing, playing board games, lifting weights, and trying uncommon foods.
